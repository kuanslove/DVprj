This is my Final project code demo.

What you need to run this demo include:

1) Python environment.  You can get it from:
http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/

2) SVG supported browser like: 
FireFox: http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/
Google Chrome: https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/
Safari: http://support.apple.com/downloads#safari

3) Internet Connetion (Just for the local JS file not worked)

How to run:
1) Install Python environment.

2) Come into the "nation" folder, and then
For windows, click "test.py" to run the server
For Linux and Mac, maybe in Prompt, type "python test.py"

3) Open your browser, type in "http://localhost:8000/index.html"
It should show a Chart with four circles.
